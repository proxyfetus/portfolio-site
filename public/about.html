            <p>Qian Qian (b.1990)<br>
                <br>artist, poet<br>
                <br>Working primarily through the medium of paper and ink, the artists work attempts to explore the
                totality of language. Highlighting the dysfuctionality of language, misunderstanding as precedent to
                understanding, individual articulation of truth and culture hybridity through translation, the artist
                discusses these themes with her ambient interactive paper sound installation, visual imagery and poetry.
                She draws inspiration from a myriad of influences including: the mythologies and folklore from differing
                ethnic and religious cultures; Newtonian and quantum explorations into mechanical events; ancient
                theological studies and the visual symbolism of alchemy; Taoist traditions and philosophical
                investigations into the impossibility of language. The stories are all referential to her works.</br>


                <br>Embracing mankind in a phenomenological sense, Qian Qian’s work awakens the (human) spirits through
                constructed situations and empathized material. Relations are automatically generated where there are
                humans and as a type of psychological acknowledgement, spiritual being can be created therefrom. The
                assembled space, cosmopolitan, cities, local library, exhibition space or the Internet, provides with a
                context where relations can be guided and reformed. Her medium varies from social practice, interactive
                installation to painting.</br>
                <br>Qian Qian works and lives in London. Her recent projects include: a solo show ‘Embryos’ in West
