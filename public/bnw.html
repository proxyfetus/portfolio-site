            <p>
                4 years ago I came to London to do my masters in art. In the end of the first year I found out that I
                was pregnant with a man whom I only knew for 4 months.<br>

                <br>Most of my friends and family was against this idea of keeping the baby without a solid foundation
                of
                relationship.<br>

                <br>We made the first decision from the rational side of us to have an abortion. But after visiting the
                clinic for abortion, we changed our mind. It was so important for us to say we are going to keep the
                baby. We saw the spirituality in the mist of the unknown future and believed that the soul reached us
                for a reason. Abortion was surely a more reasonable choice, as in many similar cases, but we decided to
                give up the autonomy and let life guide us.<br>

                <br>Motherhood has greatly humbled me. It revealed another dimension of life to me through nurturing a
                life.<br>

                <br>I exchanged the story of birth with moms with whom I made friends later on. Many of my friends disclosed
                their experience of abortion to me later on as well.<br>

                <br>I started to be drawn to these stories and the way they were told to me. I painted them in the form of
                abstract embryos and resulted in this project.<br>

                <br>Although each story is different and private, they reflect a shared fracture of life, of making, losing,
                striving, and worshipping life.<br>

                <br>We started our journey in the form of embryos. From the very beginning, we are in constant changes. I
                forgot the way I felt when I was an embryo, and there is no way I could know how I will disintegrate
                into the earth again. However, when I feel the awe of nature, I know I’m surrounded by the answers as
                well.<br>

                <br>I hope this project can grow into a database where people can contemplate their own existence in the
                world through a myriad of narrations, as well as my personal attempt to record the emotions and
                spiritual energy conveyed to me.<br>
