            <p>In the missing persons column, I look for a girl called Ren Kuanghua all around Shanghai by sticking
                posters. She fled home since she had a dream to be a poet which was objected to by her family. She
                issued her poetry Night Flight on a Chinese website. However, this figure is fictional, and invented by
                me. Who would take notice of it, believe in her actual existence, or even make fraud calls to me?<br>

                <br>To date I have received several phone calls claiming to have seen her somewhere; or more, contacted
                Ling (the searcher that I made up) through wechat, inquiring with curiosity; a large number of people went to
                Ren Kuanghua’s website and called her to go back. People’s attitude and the provided information
                contribute to the portrait of Ren Kuanghua.<br>
